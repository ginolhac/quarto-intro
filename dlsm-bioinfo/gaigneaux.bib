	ABSTRACT = {The trafficking chaperone PDE6D (or PDEδ) was proposed as a surrogate target for K-Ras, leading to the development of a series of inhibitors that block its prenyl binding pocket. These inhibitors suffered from low solubility and suspected off-target effects, preventing their clinical development. Here, we developed a highly soluble, low nanomolar PDE6D inhibitor (PDE6Di), Deltaflexin3, which has the lowest off-target activity as compared to three prominent reference compounds. Deltaflexin3 reduces Ras signaling and selectively decreases the growth of KRAS mutant and PDE6D-dependent cancer cells. We further show that PKG2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser181 lowers K-Ras binding to PDE6D. Thus, Deltaflexin3 combines with the approved PKG2 activator Sildenafil to more potently inhibit PDE6D/K-Ras binding, cancer cell proliferation, and microtumor growth. As observed previously, inhibition of Ras trafficking, signaling, and cancer cell proliferation remained overall modest. Our results suggest reevaluating PDE6D as a K-Ras surrogate target in cancer.},

	ABSTRACT = {Therapy Induced Senescence (TIS) leads to sustained growth arrest of cancer cells. The associated cytostasis has been shown to be reversible and cells escaping senescence further enhance the aggressiveness of cancers. Chemicals specifically targeting senescent cells, so-called senolytics, constitute a promising avenue for improved cancer treatment in combination with targeted therapies. Understanding how cancer cells evade senescence is needed to optimise the clinical benefits of this therapeutic approach. Here we characterised the response of three different NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines to a combination of CDK4/6 and MEK inhibitors over 33 days. Transcriptomic data show that all cell lines trigger a senescence programme coupled with strong induction of interferons. Kinome profiling revealed the activation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) and enriched downstream signaling of neurotrophin, ErbB and insulin pathways. Characterisation of the miRNA interactome associates miR-211-5p with resistant phenotypes. Finally, iCell-based integration of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data identifies biological processes perturbed during senescence and predicts 90 new genes involved in its escape. Overall, our data associate insulin signaling with persistence of a senescent phenotype and suggest a new role for interferon gamma in senescence escape through the induction of EMT and the activation of ERK5 signaling.},

	ABSTRACT = {AbstractThe Ras-MAPK pathway is critical to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Its dysregulation is implicated in the onset and progression of numerous types of cancers. To be active, Ras proteins are membrane anchored and organized into nanoclusters, which realize high-fidelity signal transmission across the plasma membrane. Nanoclusters therefore represent potential drug targets. However, targetable protein components of signalling nanoclusters are poorly established.We previously proposed that the nanocluster scaffold galectin-1 (Gal1) enhances H-Ras nanoclustering by stabilizing stacked dimers of H-Ras and Raf via a direct interaction of dimeric Gal1 with the Ras binding domain (RBD) in particular of B-Raf. Here, we provide further supportive evidence for this model. We establish that the B-Raf preference emerges from divergent regions of the Raf RBDs that were proposed to interact with Gal1. We then identify the L5UR peptide, which disrupts this interaction by binding with low micromolar affinity to the B-Raf-RBD. Its 23-mer core fragment is thus sufficient to interfere with Gal1-enhanced H-Ras nanocluster, reduce MAPK-output and cell viability inHRAS-mutant cancer cell lines.Our data therefore suggest that the interface between Gal1 and the RBD of B-Raf can be targeted to disrupt Gal1-enhanced H-Ras nanoclustering. Collectively, our results support that Raf-proteins are integral components of active Ras nanoclusters.},

Here we identify a pro-tumorigenic IL1R1+, IL-1-high-signaling subtype of fibroblasts, using multiple colorectal cancer (CRC) patient single cell sequencing datasets. This subtype of fibroblasts is linked to T cell and macrophage suppression and leads to increased cancer cell growth in 3D co-culture assays. Furthermore, both a fibroblast-specific IL1R1 knockout and IL-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra administration reduce tumor growth in vivo. This is accompanied by reduced intratumoral Th17 cell infiltration. Accordingly, CRC patients who present with IL1R1-expressing cancer-associated-fibroblasts (CAFs), also display elevated levels of immune exhaustion markers, as well as an increased Th17 score and an overall worse survival. Altogether, this study underlines the therapeutic value of targeting IL1R1-expressing CAFs in the context of CRC.},

	ABSTRACT = {[en] BACKGROUND: Neutrophils are an important source of pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines. This makes neutrophils efficient drivers of interactions with immune and non-immune cells to maintain homeostasis and modulate the inflammatory process by notably regulating the release of cytokines. Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism encompassing cytokine secretion by neutrophils are not still identified. In this context, we propose to define new insights on the role of Ca2+-binding proteins S100A8/A9 and on the regulatory role of miRNA-132-5p, which was identified as a regulator of S100A8/A9 expression, on IL-8 secretion.
		METHODS: Differentiated HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line that can be induced to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells, were used as a model of human neutrophils and treated with N- formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF), a bacterial peptide that activates neutrophils. shRNA knockdown was used to define the role of selected targets (S100A8/A9 and miRNA-132-5p) on IL-8 secretion.
		RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Different types of cytokines engage different signaling pathways in the secretion process. IL-8 release is tightly regulated by Ca2+ binding proteins S100A8/A9. miRNA-132-5p is up-regulated over time upon fMLF stimulation and decreases S100A8/A9 expression and IL-8 secretion.
		CONCLUSION: These findings reveal a novel regulatory loop involving S100A8/A9 and miRNA-132-5p that modulates IL-8 secretion by neutrophils in inflammatory conditions. This loop could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases.},

	ABSTRACT = {Background: Individuals carrying the risk variant p.I148M of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) have a higher susceptibility to fatty liver diseases and associated complications, including HCC, a cancer closely linked to chronic inflammation. Here, we assessed circulating cytokine profiles for patients with chronic liver diseases genotyped for PNPLA3.
		Methods: Serum concentrations of 22 cytokines were measured by multiplex sandwich-ELISA. The cohort comprised 123 individuals: 67 patients with NAFLD without cirrhosis (57 steatosis, 10 NASH), 24 patients with NAFLD with cirrhosis, 21 patients with HCC (15 cirrhosis), and 11 healthy controls. Receiver operator characteristic analyses were performed to assess the suitability of the cytokine profiles for the prediction of steatosis, cirrhosis, and HCC.
		Results: HGF, IL-6, and IL-8 levels were increased in patients, with ∼2-fold higher levels in patients with cirrhosis versus healthy, while platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) showed lower concentrations compared to controls. Migration inhibitory factor and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were found at higher levels in NAFLD samples (maximum: NAFLD-cirrhosis) versus healthy controls and HCC samples. In receiver operator characteristic analyses, migration inhibitory factor, IL-8, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 yielded high sensitivity scores for predicting noncirrhotic NAFLD (vs. healthy). The top combination to predict cirrhosis was HGF plus PDGF-BB. Migration inhibitory factor performed best to discriminate HCC from NAFLD; the addition of monokine induced gamma (MIG), RANTES, IL-4, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), or IL-17A as second parameters further increased the AUC values (> 0.9). No significant impact of the PNPLA3 I148M allele on cytokine levels was observed in this cohort.
		Conclusions: Cytokines have biomarker potential in patients with fatty liver, possibly suited for early HCC detection in patients with fatty liver. Patients carrying the PNPLA3 risk allele did not present significantly different levels of circulating cytokines.}

However, the crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the host in relation to tumour cell metabolism remains largely unexplored. Here we show that formate, a metabolite produced by the CRC-associated bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum, promotes CRC development. We describe molecular signatures linking CRC phenotypes with Fusobacterium abundance. Cocultures of F. nucleatum with patient-derived CRC cells display protumorigenic effects, along with a metabolic shift towards increased formate secretion and cancer glutamine metabolism. We further show that microbiome-derived formate drives CRC tumour invasion by triggering AhR signalling, while increasing cancer stemness. Finally, F. nucleatum or formate treatment in mice leads to increased tumour incidence or size, and Th17 cell expansion, which can favour proinflammatory profiles. Moving beyond observational studies, we identify formate as a gut-derived oncometabolite that is relevant for CRC progression.},

	ABSTRACT = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for about 10% of cancer deaths worldwide. Colon carcinogenesis is critically influenced by the tumor microenvironment. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the major components of the tumor microenvironment. TAMs promote tumor progression, angiogenesis and tissue remodeling. However, the impact of the molecular crosstalk of tumor cells (TCs) with CAFs and macrophages on monocyte recruitment and their phenotypic conversion is not known in detail so far. In a 3D human organotypic CRC model, we show that CAFs and normal colonic fibroblasts are critically involved in monocyte recruitment and for the establishment of a macrophage phenotype, characterized by high CD163 expression. This is in line with the steady recruitment and differentiation of monocytes to immunosuppressive macrophages in the normal colon. Cytokine profiling revealed that CAFs produce M-CSF, and IL6, IL8, HGF and CCL2 secretion was specifically induced by CAFs in co-cultures with macrophages. Moreover, macrophage/CAF/TCs co-cultures increased TC invasion. We demonstrate that CAFs and macrophages are the major producers of CCL2 and, upon co-culture, increase their CCL2 production twofold and 40-fold, respectively. CAFs and macrophages expressing high CCL2 were also found in vivo in CRC, strongly supporting our findings. CCL2, CCR2, CSF1R and CD163 expression in macrophages was dependent on active MCSFR signaling as shown by M-CSFR inhibition. These results indicate that colon fibroblasts and not TCs are the major cellular component, recruiting and dictating the fate of infiltrated monocytes towards a specific macrophage population, characterized by high CD163 expression and CCL2 production.},

	ABSTRACT = {Reduced levels of intratumoural oxygen are associated with hypoxia-induced pro-oncogenic events such as invasion, metabolic reprogramming, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, metastasis and resistance to therapy, all favouring cancer progression. Small extracellular vesicles (EV) shuttle various  cargos  (proteins,  miRNAs,  DNA  and  others).    Tumour-derived  EVs  can  be  taken  up by neighbouring or distant cells in the tumour microenvironment, thus facilitating intercellular communication. The quantity of extracellular vesicle secretion and their composition can vary with changing microenvironmental conditions and disease states. Here, we investigated in melanoma cells the influence of hypoxia on the content and number of secreted EVs. Whole miRNome and proteome profiling revealed distinct expression patterns in normoxic or hypoxic growth conditions. Apart from the well-known miR-210, we identified miR-1290 as a novel hypoxia-associated microRNA, which was highly abundant in hypoxic EVs. On the other hand, miR-23a-5p and -23b-5p were consistently downregulated in hypoxic conditions, while the protein levels of the miR-23a/b-5p-predicted targetIPO11were concomitantly upregulated. Furthermore, hypoxic melanoma EVs exhibit a signature consisting of six proteins (AKR7A2, DDX39B, EIF3C, FARSA, PRMT5, VARS), which were significantly associated with a poor prognosis for melanoma patients, indicating that proteins and/or miRNAs secreted by cancer cells may be exploited as biomarkers.},

	ABSTRACT = {Accumulating evidence suggests that dysbiosis, a state of pathological imbalance in the human gut microbiome, is present in patients suffering from colorectal cancer (CRC). 16S rRNA gene sequencing, as well as metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses, identified specific bacteria being associated with CRC. Among others, Fusobacterium ssp. have been found to directly interact with cancer or immune cells of their host. However, only a limited number of CRC-associated microbes have been examined for host-microbial interactions and, as such, the role of bacteria in the etiology of the disease remains largely elusive. 
		Our aim is the development of predictive and experimental models that allow to not only study the host-microbiota interactions but are also amenable to high-throughput experimentation and large-scale omics-data integration. Ultimately, such models should help to get from meta-omics to cellular mechanism and, moreover, serve as tools for reproducible analyses of host-microbial interaction mechanisms of on a transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic level. Our research proposes an integrative study approach allowing us to bridge meta-omics with functional mechanisms by focusing on the interaction taking place between F. nucleatum and patient-derived CRC cells.},

	ABSTRACT = {Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) revolutionized the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), resistance against TKIs and leukemia stem cell (LSC) persistence remain a clinical concern. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies combining conventional and novel therapies are urgently needed. Since telomerase is involved in oncogenesis and tumor progression but is silent in most human normal somatic cells, it may be an interesting target for CML therapy by selectively targeting cancer cells while minimizing effects on normal cells. Here, we report that hTERT expression is associated with CML disease progression. We also provide evidence that hTERT-deficient K-562 cells do not display telomere shortening and that telomere length is maintained through the ALT pathway. Furthermore, we show that hTERT depletion exerts a growth-inhibitory effect in K- 562 cells and potentiates imatinib through alteration of cell cycle progression leading to a senescence-like phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that hTERT depletion potentiates the imatinib-induced reduction of the ALDH+-LSC population. Altogether, our results suggest that the combination of telomerase and TKI should be considered as an attractive strategy to treat CML patients to eradicate cancer cells and prevent relapse by tar- geting LSCs.}

	ABSTRACT = {Elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) inhibit erythropoiesis and cause anemia in patients with cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. TNFα is also a potent activator of the sphingomyelinase (SMase)/ceramide pathway leading to ceramide synthesis and regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, senescence, and autophagy. Here we evaluated the implication of the TNFα/SMase/ceramide pathway on inhibition of erythropoiesis in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (CD34/HSPCs) from healthy donors. Exogenous synthetic C2- and C6-ceramide as well as bacterial SMase inhibited erythroid differentiation in erythropoietin-induced (Epo)CD34/HSPCs shown by the analysis of various erythroid markers. The neutral SMase inhibitor GW4869 as well as the genetic inhibition of nSMase with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3) prevented the inhibition by TNFα, but not the acid SMase inhibitor desipramine. Moreover, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a ceramide metabolite, restored erythroid differentiation, whereas TNFα inhibited sphingosine kinase-1, required for S1P synthesis. Analysis of cell morphology and colony formation demonstrated that erythropoiesis impairment was concomitant with a granulomonocytic differentiation in TNFα- and ceramide-treated EpoCD34/HSPCs. Inhibition of erythropoiesis and induction of granulomonocytic differentiation were correlated to modulation of hematopoietic transcription factors (TFs) GATA-1, GATA-2, and PU.1. Moreover, the expression of microRNAs (miR)-144/451, miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-223 was also modulated by TNFα and ceramide treatments, in line with cellular observations. Autophagy plays an essential role during erythropoiesis and our results demonstrate that the TNFα/neutral SMase/ceramide pathway inhibits autophagy in EpoCD34/HSPCs. TNFα- and ceramide-induced phosphorylation of mTORS2448 and ULK1S758, inhibited Atg13S355 phosphorylation, and blocked autophagosome formation as shown by transmission electron microscopy and GFP-LC3 punctae formation. Moreover, rapamycin prevented the inhibitory effect of TNFα and ceramides on erythropoiesis while inhibiting induction of myelopoiesis. In contrast, bafilomycin A1, but not siRNA against Atg5, induced myeloid differentiation, while both impaired erythropoiesis. We demonstrate here that the TNFα/neutral SMase/ceramide pathway inhibits erythropoiesis to induce myelopoiesis via modulation of a hematopoietic TF/miR network and inhibition of late steps of autophagy. Altogether, our results reveal an essential role of autophagy in erythroid vs. myeloid differentiation.}

	ABSTRACT = {We synthetized and investigated the anti-leukemic potential of the novel cytostatic bis(4-hydroxycoumarin) derivative OT-55 which complied with the Lipinski's rule of 5 and induced differential toxicity in various chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell models. OT-55 triggered ER stress leading to canonical, caspase-dependent apoptosis and release of danger associated molecular patterns. Consequently, OT-55 promoted phagocytosis of OT-55-treated CML cells by both murine and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Moreover, OT-55 inhibited tumor necrosis factor α-induced activation of nuclear factor-кB and produced synergistic effects when used in combination with imatinib to inhibit colony formation in vitro and Bcr-Abl+ patient blast xenograft growth in zebrafish. Furthermore, OT-55 synergized with omacetaxine in imatinib-resistant KBM-5 R cells to inhibit the expression of Mcl-1, triggering apoptosis. In imatinib-resistant K562 R cells, OT-55 triggered necrosis and blocked tumor formation in zebrafish in combination with omacetaxine.}

	ABSTRACT = {Coumarins are natural compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer potential known to modulate inflammatory pathways. Here, non-toxic biscoumarin OT52 strongly inhibited proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cells with KRAS mutations, inhibited stem-like characteristics by reducing aldehyde dehydrogenase expression and abrogated spheroid formation capacity. This cytostatic effect was characterized by cell cycle arrest and onset of senescence concomitant with endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi stress, leading to metabolic alterations. Mechanistically, this cellular response was associated with the novel capacity of biscoumarin OT52 to inhibit STAT3 transactivation and expression of its target genes linked to proliferation. These results were validated by computational docking of OT52 to the STAT3 DNA-binding domain. Combination treatments of OT52 with subtoxic concentrations of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1-targeting BH3 protein inhibitors triggered synergistic immunogenic cell death validated in colony formation assays as well as in vivo by zebrafish xenografts.}
